### Good to know about MVVM pattern architecture
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
##### 1. Model
The Model represents simple data. It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic. You can simply say it’s a plain structure of data that we are expecting from our API.
##### 2. View
To receive data from ViewModel class we have link our ViewModel property inside the view controller class

#### 3. ViewModel
ViewModel is the main component of this architecture pattern. ViewModel never knows what the view is or what the view does. This makes this architecture more testable and removes complexity from the view.
